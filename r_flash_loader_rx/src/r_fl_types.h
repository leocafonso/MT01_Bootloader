* History : DD.MM.YYYY Version  Description
*         : 22.02.2012 3.00     First Release. These structures were originally
*                               in downloader.h. They were moved here to make
*                               them easier to modify or add new ones. They 
*                               were also slightly changed to match CS v4.0.
*                               (introduced in v3.0)
